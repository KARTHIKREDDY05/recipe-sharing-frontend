The Recipe Sharing Frontend is a sleek and responsive web application built with React.js, designed to provide an intuitive platform for users to explore, share, and manage recipes. With React Router, seamless navigation ensures a smooth browsing experience, while Axios enables efficient communication with a Django backend for data retrieval and user authentication. The interface is styled using Bootstrap, ensuring a visually appealing and mobile-friendly design. From secure user login and registration pages to detailed recipe displays, the frontend is built with scalability and performance in mind, following ES6 best practices for clean and maintainable code. This project is a perfect starting point for anyone looking to build a dynamic recipe-sharing platform with modern web technologies.
